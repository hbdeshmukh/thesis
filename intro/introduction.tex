\chapter{Introduction}
Scheduling is a fundamental problem in computer systems, and physical systems. 
Systems use resources and often times these reources are finite and scarce. 
Scheduling facilitates the systems to use limited resources and share them with the users of the system.
Two examples of such systems are operating systems and database systems. 
Both systems use resources such as CPU, memory and disk.

Scheduling is a well studied problem both from theoretical and practical perspectives. 
Typicallt a scheduling problems is tasked with an objective and with a goal to find a schedule that can either meet the objective or get close to it.
\todo{For example, job scheduling with deadline}.
Many scheduling problems are difficult to solve (NP hard).
Prior work has proposed heuristics or greedy approaches to find solutions to scheduling problems. 

In this dissertation, we present scheduling for executing queries in a database system.
