This journey has been possible due to so many helping hands in my life. 
First and foremost, my advisor Prof. Jignesh Patel. 
Jignesh's infectious energy and his passion for database research has shaped a lot of the ideas in my work.
I find it fascinating that he can dive into low level implementation details with the same ease as he can paint the big picture.
I benefitted tremendously by his feedback on my writing and presentation skills. 
My well being and my family's well being was always a priority for him. 
I hope I can emulate his industriousness, discipline and his remarkable interpersonal communication skills. 

I was fortunate to be in Wisconsin's database group and interact with the professors. 
Jeff Naughton during his time in Wisconsin was like a father figure. 
His sharp and witty comments during the talks always made the atmosphere lively. 
I hope to enjoy Jeff's mentorship in my professional life. 
I have had numerous interactions with AnHai Doan.
I am grateful for his advice and support during my job search.
I thank my committee members Professors Paris Koutris, Theodoros Rekatsinas, Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau and Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau for reading my dissertation and for their helpful comments. 

I could live a debt free grad school life, thanks to the grants from the National Science Foundation which  ultimately come from the tax dollars of the millions of hardworking American men and women. 
My sincere thanks to all of them.

Life would have been very difficult without some great friends in the database group. 
Yash Govind has been a great friend and confidant.
Shaleen Deep was the sounding board for a lot of my silly ideas.
Adalbert Gerald Soosai Raj has provided immense support through good times and bad. 
I developed close friendship with Hakan Memisoglu during his time in Wisconsin.
Rogers was always available whenever I needed help, and he would always arrive along with his (poor?) jokes. 
I learnt a great deal from the long interactions with Bruhathi on the pipelining project, as well as during my job search.
Pradap Konda Venkatraman's mature demeanor and deep insights had a calming effect on me.
I thank Adel Ardalan for his help on my various presentations. 
Paul Suganthan GC helped me find accommodation during my first summer in Wisconsin. 
I had a great time working with Vinitha Reddy on many course projects.

Quickstep is a group project with contributions from several students.
My work would not have been possible without their efforts. 
I would like to thank Quickstep developers including Craig Chasseur, Qiang Zeng, Shoban Chandrabose, Yinan Li, Gerald, Zuyu Zhang, Jianqiao Zhu, Saket Saurabh, Navneet Potti, and Udip Pant.  

Through the years, I had the company of some wonderful office mates. 
I often made them walk with me to Peet's for coffee breaks.
The long chats with Hakan Memisoglu and Marc Spehlmann made walks to Gordon seem like a breeze.
I am grateful to Spyros Blanas for his tidbits of wisdom. 
An incomplete list of otther officemates include Sriram Sridharan, Yueh-Hsuan Chiang, Lalitha Viswanathan, Han Li, and Dylan Bacon.

I got to know several smart and kind people in the UW over the years. 
Prashant Saxena was my roommate for the first two years and his sense of humour would always lighten up the atmosphere. 
I had several insightful discussions with Prashant over the delicious food he cooked. 
I thoroughly relished Ankit Agrawal's company during his time in Wisconsin.
Ankit and I had numerous discussions on everything under the sun.
I still remember Friday evening tea parties with Ankit and Nishant Agrawal. 
Sanketh Nalli remains a good friend till date.
Meenakshi Syamkumar has become a close family friend. 
I am grateful to Ramnatthan Alagappan and Aishwarya Ganesan for their company for dinners and fun outings.
An incomplete list of friends in the UW include Rohit Bhat, Junaid Khalid, Ashutosh Pandey, Swapnil Haria, Amrita Roy Chowdhury, and Neha Godwal. 

My undergraduation institue BITS Pilani has a special place in my life.
Many friendships from BITS have accompanied me from India to the US. 
I have had many trips in grad school with these friends, that helped me refresh.

Soumyadeep Ghosh has been a close friend ever since undergraduation days and till date he's my goto person for venting out frustration. 
I am grateful to Aditya Vijay's great advice in so many situations.
Ankur Gupta has provided great company on various trips that we went on together.

My friends from Pilani continue to provide me moments of great joy.
I am greateful to Ameya Zambre, Nilesh Deshpande, Ankit Agrawal, Prashant Saxena, Jhinak Sen, Vineet Pandey, Apoorv Bapat, Akash Badave, Aditya Belsare, Ashirvad Singh, Chanchal Batra, Abhishek Jain, Priyanka Gupta and Pooja Chandra.

I spent the first two years of my grad school working on the BITS2MSPhD project to provide MS/PhD related assistance to aspiring undergraduates from BITS. 
Volunteering for BITS2MSPhD while in grad school helped me manage my time better.
I had a great time working with Varsha Rajshekhar, Yash Gandhi, Manish Kumar, Adwait Gandhe and Ishaan Biswas. 

Living in Madison would be dull without a fantastic group of friends.
I met a lot of people through Maharashtra Mandal in Madison. 
I am grateful to Kimaya and Rohan Pradhan, Girish and Priti Kulkarni, Nikhil and Tanuja Jog, Abhishek and Nishi Kulkarni, Milind and Rama Ranade, Bhakti and Amrish Dahale, Abhinav and Nishita Verma, Stimit and Vidhi Shah for the numerous parties and fun times together. 

Family is the ultimate support system. 
My in laws Anant and Neha Hirurkar always supported my pursuit of PhD. 
My sisters Sukhada and Sampada and their husbands Akshay and Hitesh encouraged me to follow my aspirations and took great care of my parents.
My nephews and niece provided great joy during my trips to India.

I dearly miss my late maternal grandmother. 
She was a single mother and she raised six kids on a meager income from being a primary school teacher.
Despite the hardships, she had a staunch belief in the power of education.
She has a profound influence on my life.

I can probably never do enough to repay what my parents have done for me. 
They made several sacrifices to ensure that I got a high quality education. 
They always believed in my decisions and supported me in tough times.
Whatever little success that I have achieved is a testimony to their strong foundational values.
Thank you Aai and Baba from the bottom of my heart.

I got the ultimate gift of fatherhood during grad school.
Being a father to a beautiful girl felt daunting at time, but ultimately was a very rewarding feeling.
All the stress from working in grad school would go away with a single smile of my daughter.

Last, but by no means the least, I would like to thank my wonderful wife Supriya. 
She always believed in me, even when I doubted myself. 
In bad times or good, she always kept assuring me that I was capable of making it to the finish line. 
She went to such extremes that I was not allowed to crack jokes about myself! 
She sacrificed her professional life and single handedly managed our family life so that I could focus on my PhD. 
Supriya, you made all the hardships worthwhile!
